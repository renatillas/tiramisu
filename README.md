# 🍰 Tiramisu

**A type-safe 3D game engine for Gleam**

Tiramisu brings the power of functional programming and static type safety to game development, leveraging Three.js for professional-grade 3D rendering while maintaining Gleam's elegant, immutable design principles.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```gleam
import tiramisu
import tiramisu/effect
import tiramisu/scene
import tiramisu/transform

type Model {
  Model(rotation: Float)
}

type Msg {
  Frame
}

pub fn main() {
  tiramisu.run(
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    background: 0x111111,
    init: init,
    update: update,
    view: view,
  )
}

fn init(_ctx: tiramisu.Context) {
  #(Model(rotation: 0.0), effect.none())
}

fn update(model: Model, msg: Msg, ctx: tiramisu.Context) {
  case msg {
    Frame -> {
      let new_rotation = model.rotation +. ctx.delta_time
      #(Model(rotation: new_rotation), effect.none())
    }
  }
}

fn view(model: Model) {
  [
    scene.Mesh(
      id: "cube",
      geometry: scene.BoxGeometry(1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
      material: scene.StandardMaterial(color: 0x00ff00),
      transform: transform.new()
        |> transform.rotate_y(model.rotation),
    ),
  ]
}
```

## 📦 Installation

Add Tiramisu to your Gleam project:

```sh
gleam add tiramisu@1
```

### Add Three.js and Rapier via Lustre to your gleam.toml

```toml

name = "my_game"
version = "0.1.0"
license = "MIT"

...

[tools.lustre.html]
scripts = [
  { type = "importmap", content = "{ \"imports\": { \"three\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.180.0/build/three.module.js\", \"three/addons/\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.180.0/examples/jsm/\", \"@dimforge/rapier3d-compat\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@dimforge/rapier3d-compat@0.11.2/+esm\" } }" }
]
```

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

### MVU Architecture

Tiramisu follows the Model-View-Update pattern:

- **Model**: Your immutable game state
- **Update**: Pure function that transforms state based on messages
- **View**: Declarative scene description from current state

### Effect System

Side effects (network, timers, audio) are handled through a composable effect system, keeping your update logic pure and testable.

### Scene Graph

Hierarchical node system powered by Three.js, with functional updates and transforms. Support for meshes, lights, cameras, groups, and more.
