Basic bindings to nodejs and browser platform API's.
The aim of this package is to not make any new abstractions, so binding are as near the native platform as is sensible.

## Contributing

I will just be adding API's as they are useful to me, so please don't open an issue saying something is missing. However PR's adding new API's are welcome.

Please post in the [Gleam Discord](https://discord.com/channels/768594524158427167/768594524158427170) to discuss new API's if you are unsure of the best API.
