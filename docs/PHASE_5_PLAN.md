## Timeline Estimate

### Week 1-2: Performance Optimization
- Renderer optimization and benchmarking
- Memory management improvements
- Performance guide

### Week 3-4: Testing
- Expand test suite to 200+ tests
- Add integration and property-based tests
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Week 5-8: Documentation
- Getting started guide and tutorials (weeks 5-6)
- API documentation and topic guides (weeks 7-8)
- Documentation website setup

---

## Open Questions
1. Should we use a static site generator for docs (like Lustre uses)? Or something simpler?
2. What benchmarking tools should we use for performance testing?
3. Should we create video tutorials in addition to written tutorials?
4. Do we want to support WebXR (VR/AR) in Phase 5 or save for Phase 6?

---

## Notes
- Phase 5 is about **polish and production-readiness**
- Documentation should be the **best in class** for Gleam game engines
- Performance optimizations should be **measurable** with benchmarks
- All optimizations should maintain the **functional, declarative API**

---

## Phase 6 Preview: Extras
After Phase 5, we can explore:
- Post-processing effects (bloom, SSAO, depth of field)
- UI system (buttons, text, HUD elements)
- Networking/multiplayer support
- WebXR (VR/AR) support
- Advanced audio (reverb, filters, audio graphs)
- Particle systems
- Terrain generation
- Mobile optimizations
